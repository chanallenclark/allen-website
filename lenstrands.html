STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. While each of these educational disciplines can be broken down into more specific areas and curricula, they have 
	  many aspects in common.</p></strong></center></td>
	  <td><center><img src="humms.jpg" width="200" height="200"><p><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences is a strand offered to senior high school students under the Academics track. The HUMSS Senior High School strand is designed for students who intend to take up journalism, communication arts, liberal arts, education, and other social-science related courses in college. Because these courses revolve heavily around interacting with other people, the Senior High School HUMSS strand is all about improving studentsâ€™ reading, writing, and speaking skills.</p></strong></center></td>
	  <td><center><img src="abm.jpg" width="200" height="200"><p><strong>The Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) strand would focus on the basic concepts of financial management, business management, corporate operations, and all things that are accounted for. ABM can also lead you to careers on management and accounting which could be sales manager, human resources, marketing director, project officer, bookkeeper, accounting clerk, internal auditor, and a lot more.</p></strong></center></td>

TVL track can get you employed right after senior high school. It also provides preparation for the bulk of occupations OFWs hold abroad. If you want to earn money immediately after graduation then this track is for you.</p></strong></center></td>
	  <td><center><img src="gas.jpg" width="200" height="200"><p><strong>While other strands are career-specific, GAS is great for students who are still undecided on which track to take. You can choose electives from different strands. GAS subjects are a mix of specialized subjects from the other three strands: HUMSS, ABM, STEM.</p></strong></center></td>
